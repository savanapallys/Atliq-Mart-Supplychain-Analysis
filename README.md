🚚 AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Analysis - Power BI Dashboard
Welcome to the AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Analysis project! This dashboard provides insights into the supply chain performance of AtliQ Mart, with a focus on monitoring key metrics such as order fulfilment, delivery performance, and service levels. The project was part of the October Codebasics Resume Challenge.

📋 Problem Statement
AtliQ Mart, based in Gujarat, India, operates in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara, and plans to expand into metro cities within the next two years. The company faces a significant challenge: key customers did not renew annual contracts due to delayed and incomplete deliveries. To tackle these issues before expansion, AtliQ Mart's management requested the analysis of their supply chain data.

The main objective is to monitor and improve:

✅ On-Time Delivery (OT) %
📦 In-Full Delivery (IF) %
📈 On-Time In Full (OTIF) %
🔍 Tasks Performed
As the data analyst (Achyut Golakiya 🧑‍💻), I conducted the following tasks:

Created Key Metrics:

On-Time Delivery (OT)%
In-Full Delivery (IF)%
On-Time In Full (OTIF)%
Developed the Dashboard: Designed a Power BI dashboard to track these service metrics against targets.

Identified Performance Issues:

Uncovered key areas for improvement in OTIF rates and inventory fill rates.
Proposed Improvements: Suggested logistics and inventory management enhancements to help AtliQ Mart expand into Tier 1 cities successfully.

🧮 Data Model
The Data Model integrates supply chain data, broken down into categories such as:

🛒 Customer Information
